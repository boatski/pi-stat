pi-stat
=======

A web controlled thermostat powered by a Raspberry Pi.  

This project is currently a work in progress. The code you see, while in working condition, may not be suitable for use.  


Current Feature Status:  
Thermostat: Setpoints are saved/updated.  
Schedule: Basic schedule controls and time calculation implemented.  
History: Unimplemented  
Weather: Unimplemented  

Current Goal:  
I hope to have the thermostat and scheduling fully implemented by March 1.
