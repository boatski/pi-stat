pi-stat
=======

A web controlled thermostat powered by a Raspberry Pi.  

This project is currently a work in progress. The code you see, while in working condition, may not be suitable for use.  

Need to follow [this](http://guide.python-distribute.org/creation.html) to correctly setup the project in a package.  

Current Feature Status as of 2/26:  
Thermostat: Setpoints and control logic implemented, but not displayed.  
Schedule: Schedule controls implemented.   
History: Unimplemented  
Weather: Unimplemented  

Current Goal:  
I hope to have the thermostat and scheduling fully implemented by March 1.
